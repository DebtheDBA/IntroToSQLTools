# IntroToSQLTools

This repo is to suppor the session "Intro to SQL Tools"


## Abstract

Are you an accidental DBA? After supporting or working with databases like Oracle or Postgres, have you been told that you need to start supporting and working with SQL Server? One of the most fundamental parts of learning a new technology is figuring out which tools you need to work with - and we often donâ€™t know where to start. In this session, we will take a tour of the tools that data professionals use when working with SQL Server, whether they are IDEs, portals, or CLIs. We will review what works best for different tasks. We will also look at what tools work with other database systems for those who need multi database support. By the end of this session, you should be comfortable with what tools you can use to do your job and get started with SQL Server.
